Between school, \n              building businesses, raising a creative daughter, and surviving real life, Tree learned \n              the hard way that creativity fails not because people lack talent, but because they lack \n              time, systems, and support.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-[#5C4033]\">\n              For years, Tree watched brilliant artists, writers, designers, and visionaries lose \n              momentum simply because they couldn't finish a product, format a file, write listings, \n              or market what they made. Even her daughter Harley, a gifted artist with her own unique \n              style, struggled to keep up with the \"business side\" of creativity.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font-semibold text-[#C24C1A]\">\n              Tree built ReFURRM Ai Studio to fix that.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-[#5C4033]\">\n              A platform for people like her.<br />\n              People with genius but no bandwidth.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-[#5C4033]\">\n              ReFURRM Ai Studio handles the heavy lifting. Creators upload a file or speak an idea. \n              The platform builds everything else. Product pages. Mockups. Descriptions. Social posts. \n              Emails. Landing pages. Launch kits. It's the assistant every creator wishes they had.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font-semibold text-[#5C4033]\">\n              Tree built this studio with one goal.<br />\n              To make creativity easier.<br />\n              To make finishing possible.<br />\n              To give artists and visionaries a place where their ideas don't die in a notes app or a sketchbook.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-[#5C4033]\">\n              This is a studio for creators who think fast, dream big, pivot often, and don't have time \n              for the boring stuff.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"text-center font-bold text-xl text-[#C24C1A] mt-8\">\n              Tree built it for herself.<br />\n              She built it for Harley.<br />\n              And she built it for every creator who deserves to see their ideas become something real.\n            </p>\n          </CardContent>\n        </Card>\n\n        <div className=\"text-center\">\n          <Button \n            size=\"lg\"\n            onClick={() => navigate('/signup')}\n            className=\"bg-[#C24C1A] hover:bg-[#A63D14]\"\n          >\n            Start Creating Today\n          </Button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["About","navigate","useNavigate","jsxs","jsx","Button","Card","CardContent"],"mappings":"wMAIA,SAAwBA,GAAQ,CAC9B,MAAMC,EAAWC,EAAA,EAEjB,aACG,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,4BACb,SAAAC,EAAAA,KAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,+BACb,SAAA,CAAAC,EAAAA,IAACC,EAAA,CACC,QAAQ,QACR,QAAS,IAAMJ,EAAS,GAAG,EAC3B,UAAU,sBACX,SAAA,gBAAA,CAAA,EAIDG,EAAAA,IAAC,OAAI,UAAU,oBACb,eAAC,KAAA,CAAG,UAAU,qGAAqG,SAAA,mBAAA,CAEnH,CAAA,CACF,QAECE,EAAA,CAAK,UAAU,OACd,SAAAH,EAAAA,KAACI,EAAA,CAAY,UAAU,wCACrB,SAAA,CAAAJ,EAAAA,KAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,iBACX,SAAA,CAAAC,EAAAA,IAAC,UAAO,SAAA,mBAAA,CAAiB,EAAS,mBAAgBA,EAAAA,IAAC,UAAO,SAAA,oBAAA,CAAkB,EAAS,kSAAA,EAKvF,EAEAA,EAAAA,IAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,iBAAiB,SAAA,yUAK9B,EAEAA,EAAAA,IAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,+BAA+B,SAAA,4CAE5C,EAEAD,EAAAA,KAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,iBAAiB,SAAA,CAAA,wCACI,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,sCAAA,EAEvC,EAEAC,EAAAA,IAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,iBAAiB,SAAA,uQAI9B,EAEAD,EAAAA,KAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,+BAA+B,SAAA,CAAA,8CACJ,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,mCAChB,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,oCACJ,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,qGAAA,EAEnC,EAEAC,EAAAA,IAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,iBAAiB,SAAA,kHAG9B,EAEAD,EAAAA,KAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,oDAAoD,SAAA,CAAA,mCACpC,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,iCACP,KAAA,EAAG,EAAE,2FAAA,CAAA,CAEhC,CAAA,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CACF,EAEAC,EAAAA,IAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,cACb,SAAAA,EAAAA,IAACC,EAAA,CACC,KAAK,KACL,QAAS,IAAMJ,EAAS,SAAS,EACjC,UAAU,kCACX,SAAA,sBAAA,CAAA,CAED,CACF,CAAA,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CACF,CAEJ"}
