Between school, \n              building businesses, raising a creative daughter, and surviving real life, Tree learned \n              the hard way that creativity fails not because people lack talent, but because they lack \n              time, systems, and support.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              For years, Tree watched brilliant artists, writers, designers, and visionaries lose \n              momentum simply because they couldn't finish a product, format a file, write listings, \n              or market what they made. Even her daughter Harley, a gifted artist with her own unique \n              style, struggled to keep up with the \"business side\" of creativity.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font-semibold text-pale skin-700\">\n              Tree built ReFURRM Ai Studio to fix that.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              A platform for people like her.<br />\n              People with genius but no bandwidth.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              ReFURRM Ai Studio handles the heavy lifting. Creators upload a file or speak an idea. \n              The platform builds everything else. Product pages. Mockups. Descriptions. Social posts. \n              Emails. Landing pages. Launch kits.
